Here's a short history of what I've been working on the past few years:

**2017-2018**: I worked with a great team to give SMB's access to data like never before at [Grow.com](https://grow.com). <br/>
**2018-2020**: I co-founded a SaaS startup, [Unbird](https://unbird.com), and led a small team to create a tool for product managers to analyze feedback so they could know what to build, better understand their customers, and have data to back up their decisions. <br/>
**2020**: I'm working with an amazing team to build the world's best no-code platform—[Adalo](https://adalo.com). Check it out! <br/>

*And the best is yet to come.*
